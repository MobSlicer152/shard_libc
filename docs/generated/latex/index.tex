This project is an attempt at implementing the ISO C2x standard, purely for the sake of learning as much as possible about how C works internally and maybe (hopefully) creating a usable implementation somewhere down the road. The Windows C runtime is also pretty (unnecessarily) bloated most of the time for smaller apps, so this could eventually be a viable alternative. Another awesome thing is that this implementation breaks the standard by {\bfseries{not renaming implemented POSIX/\+BSD/more obscure printf-\/related functions}}, which makes it possible to port your existing somewhat POSIX-\/dependant code to it with less effort.

Currently, there\textquotesingle{}s the code necessary to call {\ttfamily main} and have {\ttfamily argc}, {\ttfamily argv}, and {\ttfamily envp}/{\ttfamily environ} available on Windows and Linux running under x86-\/64.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{How to (theoretically) compile the library}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
Obviously, this project uses CMake for portability. Currently, it only compiles and runs the way it should on Linux. If I or someone else gets the necessary stuff done, then running the standard {\ttfamily cmake -\/S. -\/B$<$somewhere$>$ \&\& cmake -\/-\/build $<$somewhere$>$} will do the trick, providing you with {\ttfamily $<$somewhere$>$/src/libc\+\_\+shard.\{a,lib\}} and {\ttfamily $<$somewhere$>$/tests/main\mbox{[}.exe\mbox{]}} (which is a program that has a main function and nothing else (except a syscall on Linux) that is intended to be called by the {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+libc\+\_\+call\+\_\+main} function)

\textsubscript{Note\+: anything disparaging Microsoft in this project is not to be taken too seriously, I\textquotesingle{}m just frustrated with \sout{some} {\bfseries{a lot}} of their design choices that make it less fun to develop things (this especially) for their platforms. I don\textquotesingle{}t really hate them. In fact, their many products (particularly Windows and MSDOS) are quite impressive.}

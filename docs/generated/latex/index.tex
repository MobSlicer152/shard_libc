\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysubsection{What this project is and why the hell I\textquotesingle{}m doing it}\label{index_autotoc_md0}
This project is an attempt at implementing the I\+SO C2x standard, purely for the sake of learning as much as possible about how C works internally and maybe (hopefully) creating a usable implementation somewhere down the road. The Windows C runtime is also pretty (unnecessarily) bloated most of the time for smaller apps, so this could eventually be a viable alternative. Another awesome thing is that this implementation breaks the standard by {\bfseries{not renaming implemented P\+O\+S\+I\+X/\+B\+S\+D/more obscure printf-\/related functions}} \textsubscript{\+\_\+$\ast$cough$\ast$ $\ast$cough$\ast$\+\_\+ damn you Microsoft \+\_\+$\ast$cough$\ast$ $\ast$cough$\ast$\+\_\+}, which makes it possible to port your existing somewhat P\+O\+S\+I\+X-\/dependant code to it with less effort.

Currently, there\textquotesingle{}s the beginnings of the code necessary to (almost) call {\ttfamily main} and have {\ttfamily argc}, {\ttfamily argv}, and {\ttfamily envp}/{\ttfamily environ} available on Windows (currently need quite a bit of stuff like {\ttfamily malloc}) and Linux (currently segfaults somewhere around {\ttfamily main} for reasons only K\&R know) running under x86-\/64.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{How to (theoretically) compile the library}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
Obviously, this project uses C\+Make for portability. Currently, it only compiles and runs the way it should on Linux. If I or someone else gets the necessary stuff done, then running the standard {\ttfamily cmake -\/S. -\/B$<$somewhere$>$ \&\& cmake -\/-\/build $<$somewhere$>$} will do the trick, providing you with {\ttfamily $<$somewhere$>$/src/\mbox{[}lib\mbox{]}c\+\_\+shard.\{a,lib\}} and {\ttfamily $<$somewhere$>$/tests/test\+\_\+main\mbox{[}.exe\mbox{]}} (which is a program that has a main function and nothing else (except a syscall on Linux) that is intended to be called by the {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+libc\+\_\+call\+\_\+main} function)

\textsubscript{Note\+: anything disparaging Microsoft in this project is not to be taken too seriously, I\textquotesingle{}m just frustrated with \sout{some} {\bfseries{a lot}} of their design choices that make it less fun to develop for their platforms. I don\textquotesingle{}t really hate them.}
